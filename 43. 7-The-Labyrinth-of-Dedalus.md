THE LABYRINTH OF DAEDALUS

Seven-card spread


---

Spread Structure:

The layout follows the shape of a “V” — an initiatory descent into the heart of the labyrinth, with a downward path, a center, and an ascent.
Each card is a milestone, a knot along the inner path, guiding the seeker from disorientation to transformation.

The 7 Positions:

1. The Threshold – Entry Point

> What are you trying to escape from? What drives you into the labyrinth?
This is the initial doorway, conscious or unconscious. It represents the need for change, answers, or escape.



2. The Detour – Illusion

> What distracts, confuses, or holds you back?
Here illusions, attachments, or coping mechanisms emerge. It’s the first turn that risks leading you astray.



3. The Encounter – What (or Who) You Find Within

> A figure, a memory, an aspect of yourself.
The labyrinth is inhabited: a symbol, a presence, or an inner reflection surprises or challenges you.



4. The Center – The Heart of the Labyrinth

> What truth can no longer be avoided?
This is the deepest point. Here dwells the Minotaur — the shadow, the trial, or the essential teaching.



5. The Key – Unexpected Help

> What or who offers you a glimpse of light?
An insight, a hidden gift, an inner presence or gesture that restores meaning.



6. The Thread – What Guides You Out

> What prevents you from getting lost again?
The symbol of Ariadne: memory, connection, or discernment that helps you find your way back.



7. The Exit – Rebirth

> Who are you now? What do you leave behind?
The final card reveals transformation — what you’ve transcended and the face you bring back to the light of day.
