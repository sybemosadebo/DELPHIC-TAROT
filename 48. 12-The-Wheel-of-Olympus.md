Optional Cut Card – The Secret Center

The Cut of Hermes may be performed at the end of the Wheel to receive a central card that represents the synthesis, the medicine, or the inner spark.

The revealed figure or Arcana can be interpreted through one of four central archetypes:

Asclepius – Deep Healing
What your body and spirit are asking to mend.

Dionysus – Liberation
What must be released, fully lived, danced.

Hephaestus – Transmutation
What must be forged, melted, and reworked in the soul’s furnace.

Prometheus – The Cosmic Spark
The inner fire that is now ready to be offered to the world.

Usage Tip:

Use this spread during times of assessment, transition, or deep introspection.
It mirrors the entire wheel of the soul, and each card illuminates a face of it.

You may also choose to meditate on one card at a time, over 12 lunar days or 12 months of the year, following a cyclical path of growth and revelation.
