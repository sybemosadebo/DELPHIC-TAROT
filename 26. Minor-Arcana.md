MINOR ARCANA

THE FOUR SUITS OF THE DELPHIC TAROT

In the Delphic Tarot, the suits of the Minor Arcana do not follow the classical tradition of Swords, Wands, Cups, and Pentacles. Instead, they have been transmuted into four archetypal symbols deeply rooted in Greek mythology and the esoteric path.

Each suit becomes a living key, a bridge between the elements and inner experience:

The Torch of Prometheus (Fire)
Symbolizes creative energy, the ardor of the initiate, the strength that challenges darkness to bring light. It is the fire of sacrifice and evolution.

The Lyre of Apollo (Air)
Represents the enlightened mind, inner harmony, inspired speech, and the music of the soul. Where the sword divides, the lyre unites. It is intellect in service of beauty and truth.

The Shell of Aphrodite (Water)
Is the symbol of love, intuition, and deep sensitivity. It evokes the womb of the sea from which life is born and the emotional memory that guides us on the path of the heart.

The Sheaf of Demeter (Earth)
Carries the archetype of Mother Earth—concreteness, nourishment, sacred work, and the cycles of life. It is the gift of patience, harvest, and presence.

These symbols are not mere graphic representations but gateways to inner states. Using them means resonating with Myth, discovering within oneself the rhythm of the elements and the invisible powers that shape the soul.

FIRE – THE TORCH OF PROMETHEUS

Element: Will – Transformation – Initiatory Trial
Sphere: Hades – The Underworld and the Secret Fire

Key Phrase
“The flame that burns is the same that illuminates.”

Symbolic Introduction
Fire in the Delphic Tarot is the flame of Prometheus, a symbol of courage, sacred transgression, and the power to transform darkness. Each card in this suit tells of an inner battle, a test of will, or the creative power born of the fire of spirit.
Through the realm of Hades, this fire is not destructive but alchemical: it dissolves what no longer serves and purifies the essential.
It is the suit of burning actions, deep passions, and irreversible transformations.
Whoever faces these cards is called to symbolically descend into the underworld, to reclaim their power and rise again with a new light.

Associated Deities
Hades, Apollo, Ares, Athena, Dionysus, Hecate, Hephaestus, Helios, Hestia, Hyperion, Mithras, Persephone

AIR – THE LYRE OF APOLLO

Element: Mind – Vision – Higher Harmony
Sphere: Olympus – The Realm of Light and Divine Intelligence

Key Phrase
“Those who listen to the silence between the strings recognize the hidden truth.”

Symbolic Introduction
Air in the Delphic Tarot is represented by the Lyre of Apollo, an emblem of beauty born of intelligence, of the balance between thought and intuition. This suit touches the mental dimension but goes beyond logic: it tells the journey of the mind that becomes music, of thought turned into song, of ideas becoming vision.
It is the suit of conscious choices, inner conflicts of conscience, words that illuminate or wound, and knowledge that saves or divides.
Air is subtle movement, refining doubt, breath that clarifies.
Like Apollo, Air can reveal and conceal. It teaches mental discipline and the courage of clarity.

Associated Deities
Apollo, Boreas, Cronus, Hemera, Aeolus, Eos, Aether, Iris, Morpheus, Selene, Uranus, Zeus

WATER – THE SHELL OF APHRODITE

Element: Emotion – Desire – Deep Relationship
Sphere: Ocean – The Primordial Waters of Life and Feeling

Key Phrase
“The soul reflects in the heart, and the heart in the ocean’s mirror.”

Symbolic Introduction
Water in the Delphic Tarot is represented by the Shell of Aphrodite, symbol of birth, beauty, and vulnerability. This suit echoes the liquid realm of emotions, bonds, and deep intuitions.
It speaks of love, memory, wounds and healing, the flow between passion and compassion, between dream and reality.
Water is what molds and melts us, unites and confuses us. It is the suit of authentic relationships, soul movements, and the courage to feel deeply.
Aphrodite is not only seduction: she is also receptivity, surrender, and rebirth after the storm.

Associated Deities
Aphrodite, Amphitrite, Charon, Euribia, Oceanus, Persephone, Pontus, Poseidon, Styx, Thalassa, Tethys, Triton

EARTH – THE SHEAF OF DEMETER

Element: Matter – Stability – Value
Sphere: Earth – The Visible and Concrete World

Key Phrase
“What grows over time, endures beyond time.”

Symbolic Introduction
Earth in the Delphic Tarot is represented by the Sheaf of Demeter, symbol of abundance, cycles, and tangibility. This suit speaks of roots and construction, daily work, the fruits of patience, and care for what is tangible and incarnate.
Earth is what nourishes and supports. It represents practical value, family, spiritualized matter, and the legacy that is given and received.
Demeter’s wisdom is ancient and compassionate: it teaches to recognize what is fertile and what must be left to rest.
It is the suit of solid action, inner harvest, and service that builds.
