WITHIN THE WOMB OF THE GODDESSES

Six-card spread – The Sacred Womb of the Soul

Spread Shape: Two triads — one upper (Major Arcana), one lower (Minor Arcana) — arranged in a mirrored triangle or open womb.

[1] Hestia        [2] Demeter     [3] Hera  
[4] Aphrodite     [5] Athena      [6] Artemis


---

Purpose of the Spread:

To enter the heart of archetypal feminine wisdom.
The three upper goddesses represent eternal forces that guide the soul.
The three lower ones reveal how these energies are reflected in daily life — in our conflicts, desires, and actions.

Draw 3 Major Arcana for cards 1, 2, and 3 (Hestia, Demeter, Hera).

5. Athena – Mind and Strategy (Minor Arcana)
How do I face challenges?
