THE SPECULAR MIRROR

Two-card spread – Conscious and Unconscious

Purpose: to reveal the dialogue between the two parts of the self: the one that acts and the one that dreams, the one that sees and the one that guides from within. A confrontation between the light of consciousness and the silent currents of the unconscious.

When to use it:

to clarify an inner dynamic

to better understand a conflict between desire and fear

to bring to the surface what is latent but active

to harmonize mind and heart



---

Procedure:

1. Shuffle the deck calmly, bringing attention to your inner state.


2. Place two cards on the table, one on the right and one on the left, both face down.


3. Turn over the card on the right first: this is the conscious message — what you know, think, or perceive.


4. Then turn over the card on the left: this is the unconscious message — what moves beneath the surface, influencing or supporting from behind the scenes.

Symbolic Note:

The right side represents action, speech, and awareness.
The left side is intuition, memory, and origin.
Looking at both means truly looking in the mirror — with honest eyes.
