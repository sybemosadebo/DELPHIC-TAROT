SUIT OF TORCHES

ACE OF TORCHES

Hero: Prometheus

Keywords: Revelation, gift, courage, divine spark

Card Description: 
Prometheus emerges from a dark cave, in the foreground. In his right hand, he lifts a blazing torch the divine fire he has just stolen from the gods to offer to humanity. His face is serious yet proud, lit by the warm glow of the flame. Behind him, a volcanic landscape fades into shadow; before him, the torchlight begins to illuminate the path.

Symbolic Message: 
A sacred act of rebellion. This fire is not destruction, but beginning. It is the strength of one who risks everything to ignite the world's consciousness.

TWO OF TORCHES

Heroine: Atalanta

Keywords: Crossroads, decision, duality, inner direction

Card Description: 
Atalanta is depicted from behind, standing before a forked path in the landscape. She wears her huntress attire, the same as in the Lovers Arcana. Her golden bow is visible across her back, symbolizing readiness and identity. Before her, two large torches float in the air. One on the left burns with an intense red flame; the other, on the right, emits a deep blue and cold fire. Both seem to indicate different paths: one brighter, the other shadowed. Atalanta stands still, as if listening to an inner voice before taking the decisive step.

Symbolic Message: 
You stand at a crossroads. The choice is not between good and evil, but between the familiar and the transformative. The blue flame burns in silence, the red one in desire. Only the heart knows where to go.

TREE OF TORCHES

Hero: Daedalus

Keywords: Vision, preparation, building, intention

Card Description: 
Daedalus stands centered before the incomplete construction of the Labyrinth. His gaze is fixed on the work in progress: three walls at different stages of development extend before him. On the first, already complete, a burning torch is mounted—symbol of the realized idea. The second, halfway built, holds a torch with a weak, newly lit flame—a project underway. The third, only a rock on the ground, bears an unlit torch—symbol of what is still in potential. Daedalus holds open scrolls and builder's tools, but his eyes are lost in thought, absorbed in a future vision. Behind him, the dawn tinges the sky with shades of orange and gold.

Symbolic Message: 
The Three of Torches speaks to the moment where vision meets reality. Each lit or unlit torch is a state of being and creation. The construction is slow, but the inner fire guides the gesture: what you imagine can become real, one step at a time.

FOUR OF TORCHES

Heroine: Artemis

Keywords: Celebration, natural harmony, community, sacred rhythm, freedom

Card Description: 
In the heart of a flower-filled glade, four torches mark a glowing circle. Artemis dances at the center in a green huntress tunic, her long hair flowing with her movements. She wears a silver diadem adorned with a crescent moon. Around her, nymphs and young dancers celebrate the full moon and their union with nature. Some play flutes and drums, others carry floral garlands in their hands. The atmosphere is joyful, intimate, harmonious.

Symbolic Message: 
Celebration is not only ecstasy but grounding. The Four of Torches reminds us that joy finds home when born from connection with the world's rhythm. Artemis shows that even in sacred solitude, one can dance with life, alongside other beings.

FIVE OF TORCHES

Heroes: Ares and Athena

Keywords: Conflict, competition, duality, trial of strength

Card Description: 
In a green field at sunset, a tall wooden pillar stands in the center. From it protrude four burning torches—two on each side—while a fifth, larger torch is embedded in the pillar's front. To the left of the pillar, Ares advances armed with shield and spear, clad in red armor and helmet. On the right, Athena faces him with sword and shield, in golden armor, her face calm yet determined. Both are ready to duel, representing two forms of conflict: instinctive and strategic.

Symbolic Message: 
The Five of Torches speaks of tension between opposing forces, of the clash that precedes clarity. Ares and Athena do not only battle each other but embody two approaches to struggle: impulsive and lucid. The trial is inevitable, but it is the torchlight that will guide awareness through the challenge.

SIX OF TORCHES

Hero: Diomedes

Keywords: Triumph, recognition, return, glory, well-earned success

Card Description: 
Diomedes rides proudly toward his homeland. He wears a splendid golden armor, shining in the sunset light. In his right hand, he raises his sword to the sky as a sign of victory. His white horse, adorned with red ribbons, proceeds confidently between two rows of burning torches: six in total, three on each side, burning in his honor. The crowd is not visible, but garlands and streamers fluttering in the wind suggest a celebratory presence.

Symbolic Message: 
Glory is not an end, but the visible fruit of a journey taken with honor. The Six of Torches reminds us that true victory brings light even to those who waited, and that return is an integral part of heroism.

SEVEN OF TORCHES

Hero: Hippolytus

Keywords: Resistance, coherence, inner courage, defense of one's values

Card Description: 
Hippolytus stands atop a rocky outcrop, his body tense yet steady. In his right hand he holds a burning torch raised to the sky, symbolizing his integrity. At his feet, six menacing torches point toward him, planted in the ground and directed upward, like hands trying to extinguish him or pull him down. His face is serious, gaze fixed not on the aggressors but on a spiritual destination.

Symbolic Message: 
True strength lies not in numbers, but in the truth one embodies. The Seven of Torches is the flame that resists the wind, the light that does not bend to external pressure. Be steady in what you are, even when all seek to snuff you out.

EIGHT OF TORCHES

Hero: Iris

Keywords: Speed, divine message, acceleration, manifestation, synchronicity

Card Description: 
Iris glides through the twilight sky, her long cloak flowing in the wind and reflecting rainbow hues. Around her, eight flaming torches fly diagonally from left to right, like streaks of light in the sky. Each burns with a different flame (red, blue, gold...), representing eight distinct intentions about to manifest. Iris is in motion, her arm stretched forward as if guiding the torches in their flight. Her eyes are luminous, inspired by an urgent message to deliver. Behind her, light clouds open in a spiral, creating a clear trajectory.

Symbolic Message: 
The moment is now. When everything aligns, thought becomes action and the flame finds its direction. Iris reminds you that you are not only the messenger: you are also the message.


---

NINE OF TORCHES

Hero: Ajax

Keywords: Wound, endurance, vigilance, honor, survival

Card Description: 
Ajax stands firm, wounded but steady, with his back resting against a rough stone wall. His armor is damaged, his face marked by fatigue and battles. Around him, eight burning torches are planted in the ground, forming a sort of protective luminous barrier. Some are tilted, worn down, but still burn. The sky is dark, a sign of another impending attack. But Ajax does not sleep, does not yield: he holds a torch like a weapon, his gaze watchful, determined to stand till the end.

Symbolic Message: 
Even when all seems lost, courage is measured by the ability to remain standing. The Nine of Torches reminds us that every wound is a trial overcome. The flame that remains is the most precious.

TEN OF TORCHES

Hero: Atlas

Keywords: Responsibility, weight of the world, perseverance, light in the dark

Card Description: 
In the cosmic void dotted with stars, Atlas is depicted nude, with only a white cloth tied around his waist. He kneels, arms raised to bear the enormous Earth Globe on his shoulders—symbol of the totality of existence. His body is tense but firm, marked by fatigue and dedication. Around the globe, ten torches are embedded in the cosmic soil, forming a circle of light that pierces the darkness. Some torches stand upright, others lean slightly, but all burn intensely, like sentinels of hope and courage.

Symbolic Message: 
The weight you carry is not yours alone: it is the weight of consciousness, of history, of intertwined lives. The torches are there to remind you that even in extreme fatigue, a light accompanies you. Do not abandon the burden: you are lighting the way for others.
